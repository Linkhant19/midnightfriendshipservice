# The Midnight Friendship Service
#### a poem collection - written and designed by Lin

<br>
<br>

A few musical poems I wrote after graduation. It also has a card collection page for some of my drawings. 

This collection is about the closest friendships, <br>
some more tender, <br>
some more tragic. <br>
It is for those who find themselves coping more than healing. These explored perspectives came from a boy trying to express something no one taught him how to say. So, I hope you will be kind. I hope you will provide feedback. I hope you give The Midnight Friendship Service a chance.
